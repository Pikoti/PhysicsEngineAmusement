Little physics engine with collisions

*Index of files* </br>
Integration only:</br>
RK4-2D.js Runge-Kutta integration method applied for 2D motion (x,t).</br>
RK4-3D.js Runge-Kutta integration method applied for 3D motion (x,y,t).</br>

Those files only focus on the Runge-Kutta method. A little loop is here only to test.</br>

Physics engine & miscellanous:</br>
bouncingxy.js  is a physics engine simulating linear and parabolic movement in a gravity field with collisions on bounds, </br>
also includes a gameloop in js, and a little catch-me feature with a little beginning of scoring.</br>

The script is included in index.html.</br>
style.css is the css of index.html.</br>
